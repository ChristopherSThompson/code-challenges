# Warmup Challenge: Sorting

Given a list of strings where each string is 2 words, a _first name_ and _last name_ separated by a space, write a function that sorts the list by last name, *then* first name.

> example:
```python
["Anna Smith", "John Anderson", "Cliff Bates"]
```
> sorts to:
```python
["John Anderson", "Cliff Bates", "Anna Smith"]
```
