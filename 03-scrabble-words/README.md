# Challenge:  Scrabble Word Finder

Write a program that reads in a lexicon file of valid dictionary words.  The program then accepts a player's rack of letters (a list size 1-10) and produces the top _N_ playable words based on scrabble score.

A word is considered playable only if it is contained in the lexicon and all letters required to form the word are in the supplied rack.

See [sowpods.txt](./sowpods.txt) as an example lexicon of valid words.
