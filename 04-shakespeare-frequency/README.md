# Challenge: Shakespeare Word Frequency

Write a program that reads in the collective works of William Shakespeare and prints out the top _N_ most frequently occurring words.   Take care in dealing with punctuation and letter case.

Modify the program so that a list of "stop words" can be supplied which are ignored in the counts.  e.g. ignore common articles such as "a" and "the".
